  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="small"><strong>App:</strong> FGB Publisher<br>
  <strong>Last updated:</strong> August 13, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use <strong>FGB Publisher</strong> (the “Service”).
    This document is a template and may require customization for your organization. Nothing here is legal advice.
  </p>

  <h2>Who we are</h2>
  <p>
    Controller/Operator: <em>Fanmi Gwoup Bousol</em><br>
    Contact: <em>fanmigwoupbousol@gmail.com</em> • <em>[Mailing Address]</em>
  </p>

  <h2>Information we collect</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account and OAuth data</strong>: limited profile information returned by Meta (e.g., user ID), Page IDs, Page names, and the specific permissions you approve.</li>
      <li><strong>Content you provide</strong>: media files, titles, descriptions, captions, scheduling times, and other post metadata you submit through the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Tokens and credentials</strong>: Page access tokens or system-user tokens necessary to publish to Pages you manage. We store only what’s required to operate and refresh tokens when applicable.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage & logs</strong>: timestamps, API request/response metadata, diagnostics, and device information (such as IP address and user-agent) for security and troubleshooting.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticate you with Meta and determine which Pages you manage.</li>
    <li>Create, schedule, and publish content to your authorized Pages via the Graph API.</li>
    <li>Provide support, detect abuse, secure the Service, and monitor performance.</li>
    <li>Comply with applicable laws, platform policies, and enforce our Terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legal bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – to operate the Service you request.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – to secure and improve the Service.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> – where required (e.g., specific marketing or optional analytics).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vendors/Processors</strong> that help us host, store, and process data (bound by contract).</li>
    <li><strong>Legal/Compliance</strong> when required by law or to protect rights, safety, and integrity.</li>
    <li><strong>Platform providers</strong> (Meta) via their APIs strictly to perform the actions you request.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain data only as long as needed for the purposes above. You may revoke Page access at any time from Facebook settings, which can disable our ability to act on your behalf. We may retain minimal logs as required for security, audit, or legal obligations.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use industry-standard measures to protect data (encryption in transit, least-privilege access, token hashing/rotation where feasible). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>
    The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them.
  </p>

  <h2>International transfers</h2>
  <p>
    We may process data in countries other than where you reside. Where applicable, we rely on appropriate safeguards for cross‑border transfers.
  </p>

  <h2>Your rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>EEA/UK</strong>: access, correct, delete, port, and object/restrict processing.</li>
    <li><strong>California</strong>: right to know, delete, and opt‑out of “sale/share” of data (we do not sell personal information).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise rights, contact us at <em>fanmigwoupbousol@gmail.com</em>. We may need to verify your identity.</p>

  <h2>Third‑party services</h2>
  <p>
    Your use is also subject to <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/other-policies/terms-of-service/">Meta’s terms and policies</a> and any other integrated services you choose.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice (e.g., via the app or email). Continued use means you accept the updated Policy.
